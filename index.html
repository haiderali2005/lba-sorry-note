<h5>I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely apologize for any offense or discomfort I may have caused by adding girls to the LEKIN BHAI ASSOCIATION group chat. I understand that my actions may have crossed a line and caused confusion or unease among our senior friends, and for that, I am truly sorry.
    My intention was never to upset anyone or disrupt the dynamics of our group. I thought it might be a fun and inclusive idea to include more people in our conversations and share our camaraderie with a wider circle. However, I now realize that I should have considered everyone's feelings and discussed this idea with you all beforehand.
</h5>

<h5>
    I deeply value the friendships and bonds we've formed within the LEKIN BHAI ASSOCIATION, and I want to assure you that my actions were not meant to undermine or disrespect those bonds in any way. I understand that there are certain expectations and traditions within our group, and I should have been more sensitive to them.

Moving forward, I will make sure to be more considerate of our group's dynamics and traditions, and I will always consult with all of you before making any significant changes to our group chat. Please accept my apology for any disruption or discomfort my actions may have caused.
</h5>

<h5>I hope that we can put this incident behind us and continue to strengthen our friendships within the LEKIN BHAI ASSOCIATION. Your understanding and forgiveness mean a lot to me, and I am committed to learning from this experience and being a more considerate member of our group.

    If you have any concerns or suggestions on how we can avoid such misunderstandings in the future, please feel free to share them with me. I value your input and want to ensure that our group remains a welcoming and harmonious space for all.</h5>

<h5>Once again, I am truly sorry for any offense or discomfort I may have caused, and I look forward to moving past this incident and enjoying the camaraderie of our wonderful group.</p>

<h5>Sincerely,</h5>

<h5>[Haider]</h5>
